                The Tuesday and Thursday discussion meetings are considered
                problem-solving sessions during which you can learn from the TA
                and your peers. To get good use of this time, it is important
                for you to have attempted at least some of the currently
                assigned problems. Part of your grade is based on the TA's
                assessment of your participation in these meetings.

                <!--In this course you will learn about fundamental operations on mathematical functions: limits, derivatives, and integrals. These are idealized operations that have enormous consequences for the study of the natural world, and you will see them in action in your group project. You will also learn about new fundamental functions, exponentials, logarithms, to go alongside polynomials and trig functions, and how they relate to the operations of calculus. We end with a brief look at how equations involving derivatives are used to explain and describe the behavior of natural systems.-->

              <li>If you have an illness or emergency that causes an absence or
              homework lateness, contact me at your first reasonable
              opportunity. If you must miss an exam or an extended period, your
              emergency will require some documentation such as a doctor's
              note. Your dean's office can authenticate such excuses for all of
              your classes.
              </li>
              <li>Be courteous and respectful: arrive on time and don't distract
              others. Conversely, I will always try to be respectful and fair
              with you.

            <ul>
              <li>Take charge. This is <i>your</i> education. Nobody else can
              give it to you.
              </li>
              <li>It's a marathon, not a sprint. This course rewards
              steady, consistent effort.
              </li>
              <li>Use office hours. It's best if you come prepared with
              specific questions.
              </li>
              <li>To prepare for an exam, simulate the exam. You and a friend
              separately copy down 5-6 problems like those in the homework.
              Exchange papers, put everything away, go to a quiet place, and
              give yourself 50 minutes to do the best you can. Meet up with
              your friend and grade each other's papers as honestly as
              possible.
              </li>
              <li>Concentrating on your weaknesses is the best strategy to
              improve your score.
              </li>
              <li>College is stressful, and math courses are infamously hard.
              We find out who we are by being challenged. If you are having a
              rough time in this class, keep it in perspective. If you are
              having a hard time keeping perspective, seek help.
