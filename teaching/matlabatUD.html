    <h3>Using MATLAB at UD</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>MATLAB is installed in a few (not most) public PC and Mac labs. Try Smith, Spencer, or DuPont Lab. Your department may have
    its own lab with access.</li>

    <li>If you have your own computer, you can buy the <a
    href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/studentversion/">student
    version</a> of MATLAB for about $100.</li>

    <li>You can use your "composer" account on copland. (For UNIX account help, <a
    href="http://www.udel.edu/topics/os/unix/index.html"> go
    here</a>.) Running graphically (e.g., being able to see the fancy interface and figure windows) 
    from strauss or brahms requires an "X server"
    on your computer. X is a standard allowing another computer to open windows on your display.
    It does not ship with Windows. <b>By itself, telnet from Windows or Mac will not
    give you access to MATLAB graphics.</b>
    You can make an X connection from an X terminal in a lab, or from your own PC using
    free software <a href="http://x.cygwin.com">Cygwin/X</a>. (I have no Mac OSX experience, but it should be possible from there as well.)
    <p>Once you have logged on, first enter
    <blockquote>
      <pre>newgrp xxxx</pre>
    </blockquote>
    at the UNIX prompt in a shell window. Here "xxxx" is a <i>project number</i> assigned to the course, available
    from your instructor. This step makes sure that your
    activities are not charged against your general email
    account. You must then tell the mainframe where to display its windows. This is fairly automatic
    in Exceed; from a public terminal you should ask for local help on setting your "DISPLAY variable".
    Finally, enter
    <blockquote>
      <pre>matlab &amp;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    at the prompt to run MATLAB.</p> </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Printing from MATLAB at an X terminal</h3>

    If you are using an X terminal (such as those in Smith Hall), and you
    have trouble printing to the local printers, try one of the following
    alternatives.
    <ul>
      <li>
	Work around the problem by always printing in two steps:
	<pre>
>> print -f1 myfig.ps
>> !qpr -q smips myfig.ps</pre>
	This would print Figure 1 on the Smith printer. (Check with
	someone at the lab for the correct queue name in other labs.)
      <li>
	Set up MATLAB to print correctly, but for only one lab, as
	follows:
	<ol>
	  <li>Exit MATLAB if it is running. At the prompt type
<pre>
strauss.udel.edu% cd ~; mkdir matlab
</pre>
	    If a "File exists" error occurs, ignore it.
	  <li>Start MATLAB and enter
<pre>
>> cd matlab
>> !pwd
>> edit printopt</pre>
When the Editor opens, look for the comment "Put your own changes to
	    the defaults here." On the next line, enter
<pre>
pcmd = 'qpr -q smips';
</pre>
	    This is correct for Smith; you need to replace smips with
	    something else in another lab (ask for help). 
	  <li>Click
	    <b>File/Save As...</b> in the Editor. In the "Path or
	    folder name" box, enter the output you got from "!pwd"
	    above. Then click <b>OK</b>. You can close the Editor if
	    you wish.  
	  <li>To check, enter
<pre>
>> printopt
</pre>
	    The result should be
<pre>
ans = 

qpr -q smips
</pre>
	    or whatever you used for pcmd. Now all printing should
	    work as expected forever.
     </ol>
     </ul>
