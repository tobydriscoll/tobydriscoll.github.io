      <dd> You are expected and encouraged to discuss problems with others. However,

           <p>I reserve the right to refer all instances of academic dishonesty to the Office of Judicial Affairs without

           <a href="http://www.udel.edu/judicialaffairs/ai.html">the official university policies regarding academic integrity</a>.</p>
      </dd>

    <dt>Homework</dt>
      <dd>There will be up to ten homework assignments, to be collected on Wednesdays. Each assignment will consist of three tiers of problems:
       <i>Drill problems</i>, which cover basic topics straightforwardly, and are not to be handed in; <i>regular problems</i>, 
       which are to be fully completed and turned in for credit; and <i>challenge problems</i>, which are optional but count 
       for "extra" credit (see Grading below). 
      <p>You are encouraged to discuss problems with others, but (except for challenge problems) you are expected to write out and turn in individual, original solutions. 
      </dd>
      
    <dt>Exams</dt>
      <dd>There will be two midterm exams on nonoverlapping units of the course
      and a comprehensive final. No electronic devices will be allowed on any exams.</dd>

        <p>Challenge problems: You are free to ignore the challenge problems entirely. However, each challenge problem 
        is worth up to two percentage points added to your final course average (hence, they are quite valuable!). 
        You may work with up to two others on a challenge problem, in which case credit is divided evenly. 
        No person may earn more than 10 percentage points using challenge problems.       </dd>
 

        <dt>Synopsis</dt>
        <dd>
        MATH 508 is about one of the most beautiful topics in mathematics: complex numbers.
         At first they may seem like an unlovable kludge--indeed, mathematicians disdained them for centuries. 
         But in fact they lead to results that are deep and surprising, yet easily stated.
         Furthermore, we know now that complex numbers are sometimes the simplest way to unify or illuminate many 
         problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering. 
        <p>Here is an overview of the topics we will cover. Book sections are a guideline--go to class to find out what is actually covered.</p>
