        <i>Office hours:</i>Mondays and Thursdays, 10:30-12:00<br>
      </dd>
    
    <dt>Meetings</dt>
      <dd>MWF 1:25-2:15, in 207 Ewing. You are responsible for what is covered in class.</dd>
    
    <dt>Required textbook</dt>

    <dt>Academic integrity</dt>
      <dd>You are expected and encouraged to discuss problems with others.
        However, the work you turn in must be completely your own. <b>Sharing
        or copying of work may result in grade penalties for all involved
        parties.</b> I reserve the right to refer all instances of
        academic dishonesty to the Office of Student Conduct without warning and on the
        first offense. You should carefully read <a href="http://www.udel.edu/studentconduct/ai.html">the official
        university policies regarding academic integrity</a>.
      </dd>


    <dt>MATLAB</dt>
	<dd>You will be using MATLAB, the leading computing environment in science and engineering. 
	No prior experience with MATLAB is required. 
	(You should, however, have taken at least one course in programming.) There are lots of 
	<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/examples.html">official video tutorials</a> available.</dd>

    <dt>Canvas</dt>
	<dd>We will be making heavy use of Canvas, a Sakai alternative. You will spend a lot of time interacting
	with the <a href="www.udel.edu/canvas">Canvas course site</a>. Most class dates 
	will have an associated Canvas module that has deadlines.</dd>
	 
	 <dt>Flipping</dt>
	 <dd>This course will be "flipped", meaning that you will be responsible for viewing video content and answering
	 short quizzes <b>before</b> class, then working on assignments <b>during</b> class to be uploaded by the end of
	 the period.</dd>
	 
   
	  <dt>Exams</dt>
	  <dd>There will be two midterms (<b>October 3</b> and <b>November 2</b>) and one final exam.

		<p>You live in a heavily quantified world. Once in numerical form, data can be subjected
		to algorithms in order to yield insights. While the breadth and pace of these efforts have accelerated
		recently, the tradition of applying algorithms to numerical representations of reality
		goes back to the roots of civilization in virtually all major cultures. In the twentieth century, these efforts picked 
		up steam as automatic and reprogrammable computers were invented. Soon there will be very few areas of scientific and
		economic activity left untouched by numerical algorithms.</p>     
		
		<p>Because the real numbers are an abstraction that we can only approximate, the mathematics of numerical computation is 
		subtle at times. Mathematically equivalent formulas may be quite different in terms of a
		computer implementation, so multiple approaches to the same problem may be necessary. In fact, most of this semester 
		will be spent on seemingly "elementary" algebra problems. Our motivation for these problems come from major areas of 
		current research, such as image processing, machine learning, and molecular dynamics. While we only skim the surface of these 
		huge subjects, applications of them and in other areas of computing very often boil down to the same kinds of 
		algebraic problems, just as advanced mathematics often involves some algebraic manipulation along the way.</p>
        
       <p>Here is an overview of the topics we will study:</p>
