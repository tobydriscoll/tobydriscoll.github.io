    <h2>Course information for MATH 349:<br>Elementary Linear Algebra</h2>
    <dl>
    <dt>Instructor</dt>
      <dd>Prof. Toby Driscoll<br>
        505 Ewing Hall<br>
        831-3383 or driscoll(AT)math.udel.edu<br>
        <i>Office hours:</i> Mondays 2-4, Wednesdays 3-4<br>
      </dd>
    
    <dt>Meetings</dt>
      <dd>TR 9:30-10:45, in 122 Sharp (T) and 205 Ewing (R). You are responsible for what is covered in class.</dd>
    
    <dt>Required textbook</dt>
      <dd>Kolman and Hill, <i>Elementary Linear Algebra</i>, 8th ed.</dd>
    
    <!--dt>Participation</dt>
	<dd>You are expected to attend on time and pay reasonable attention (nobody's perfect). In addition, half of the lectures will be in a computer lab where you will be asked to follow actively. A nominal part of the grade is devoted to participation, ranging from 5 points (acceptable) to zero (I thought you dropped after the first week).</dd-->

    <dt>MATLAB</dt>
	<dd>The focus of the course is on concepts and their applications, with some hand computation on small examples. Eventually though, repeated mechanical computations add nothing. Therefore I will sometimes demonstrate how to do them in MATLAB, a computer package available in several campus labs (including Smith). You will be allowed to make limited use of MATLAB or any system of your choice, as directed on the individual assignments.</dd>

    <dt>Due dates</dt>
      <dd>Assignments are due at the beginnings of class periods. Extensions may be granted if you can demonstrate a genuine emergency. <b>Heavy workload in other courses does not qualify for an extension.</b> Late work will not be
        accepted without a valid extension.</dd>
    
    <dt>Academic integrity</dt>
      <dd>You are expected and encouraged to discuss problems with others.
        However, the work you turn in must be completely your own. <b>Sharing
        or copying of work may result in grade penalties for all involved
        parties.</b> I reserve the right to refer all instances of
academic dishonesty to
        the Office of Judicial Affairs without warning and on the
        first offense. You should carefully read 
        <a href="http://www.udel.edu/judicialaffairs/ai.html">the official
        university policies regarding academic integrity</a>.
      </dd>

    <dt>Homework</dt>
      <dd>
      There will be 8 homework assignments due throughout the semester. You are
required to turn in all of the problems, even though only a subset of them will
be graded. The homework problems are the only chance you get to test your
understanding of the material before exams, so I encourage you to invest a lot
of time in them. Since they are worth a healthy portion of the grade, I expect
them to be written neatly and completely.</dd>

      
    <dt>Exams</dt>
      <dd>There will be three midterm exams on nonoverlapping units of the
course, and a comprehensive final.</dd>

    <!--dt>Project</dt>
      <dd>There will be two brief laboratory-style projects during the term.
Each will feature a little exposure to one of two important computing
enviornments: Maple and MATLAB. Prior knowledge of MATLAB is not required.

        <dt>Synopsis</dt>
        <dd>
        MATH 349 is unique in that it combines a rigorous approach to
mathematical material in a subject that is absolutely vital to every branch of
the natural and quantitative social sciences. The central topic is
<i>linearity</i>, which is an extension of the simple straight line to multiple
variables. Many important phenomena are naturally linear, and in other
cases linearity can usually serve
as a good first approximation. Linearity also creates a very precise and
well-defined sort of mathematical structure.
        

        <p>Here is an overview of the topics. Book sections are meant as guidelines only.</p>
