dates the classes will be combined. You are responsible for what is covered in

    <dt>Academic integrity</dt>
      <dd>You are expected and encouraged to discuss problems with others.
        However, the work you turn in under your name must be completely your
own. <b>Sharing
        or copying of work may result in grade penalties for all involved
        parties.</b> We reserve the right to refer all instances of
        academic dishonesty to
        the Office of Judicial Affairs without warning and on the
        first offense. You should carefully read 
        <a href="http://www.udel.edu/judicialaffairs/ai.html">the official
        university policies regarding academic integrity</a>.
      </dd>

    <dt>Due dates</dt>
      <dd>Assignments are due at the beginnings of class periods. Extensions may
be granted if you can demonstrate a genuine emergency. <b>Heavy workload in
other courses does not qualify for an extension.</b> Late work will not be
        accepted without a valid extension.</dd>

    <dt>Homework</dt>
      <dd>
      There will be 6 homework assignments due throughout the semester. Since
they are worth a healthy portion of the grade, we expect them to be written up
neatly and completely. You are encouraged to use a computer for writeups--see
the web site for some resources.</dd>

      
    <dt>Exams</dt>
      <dd>There will be two midterm exams on nonoverlapping units of the
course, and a comprehensive take-home final.</dd>

	<p>The following minimums are guaranteed: 85%, some
form of A; 70%, some B; 50%, some C. However, we may choose to lower these
minimums during the semester.</p>

        <dt>Synopsis</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>Partial differential equations typically result from models of phenomena that depend continuously on more than one variable---in most cases, one or more space dimensions and/or time. These equations arise frequently in virtually all fields of physical, biological, and earth science and engineering, as well as in certain social sciences such as economics. PDEs exhibit a wide variety of behaviors, even as compared to ordinary differential equations (one variable only), and understanding even one in detail can take a life's work. Fortunately, they can be grouped into three broad classes, each of which is represented by a major type of equation from classical physics. The majority of our time will be devoted to understanding the Big Three models, their major mathematical properties, and the tools used to explore them. We will also encounter more specialized problems and get some insight into their behavior.</p>
        

        <p>Here is an overview of the topics. Some material will follow the text closely, but in other cases the only source material will be the lectures and the website.</p>
