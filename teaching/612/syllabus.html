    <h2>Course information for MATH 612:<br>Numerical equation solving and function optimization</h2>
    <dl>
    <dt>Instructor</dt>
      <dd>Prof. Toby Driscoll<br>
        505 Ewing Hall<br>
        831-3383 or driscoll(AT)udel.edu<br>
        <i>Office hours:</i> TBA<br>
      </dd>
    <dt>Meetings</dt>
      <dd>MW 5:00-6:15, in Ewing 207.</dd>
    
    <dt>Textbooks</dt>
      <dd>L. N. Trefethen and D. Bau, <i>Numerical Linear Algebra</i>, SIAM.<br>
	  J. E. Dennis, Jr. and R. B. Schnabel, <i>Numerical Methods for Unconstrained Optimization and Nonlinear Equations</i>, SIAM.
     
      <p>Optional references: <i>Matrix Computations</i> by Golub and Van Loan, <i>Practical Methods of Optimization</i> by R. Fletcher. </dd>
	  
	<dt>Class format</dt>
	<dd>This will not be a traditional lecture course. For <b>each Wednesday</b> meeting, you will have assigned sections to read before class. There will be a short quiz on those sections at the beginning of the period. The rest of the period will be a discussion of the reading, typically focused on practical computing illustrations and issues. For <b>each Monday</b> meeting, you will have to complete assigned homework problems. You will turn in up to two homework problems per week for grading, and the rest of the period will be for student-led discussions of the solutions.
      
    <dt>Academic integrity</dt>
      <dd> You are expected and encouraged to discuss problems with others. However,
            the work you turn in must be completely your own. This is true of written work and computer code.
           For example, fixing an error in one line of a classmate's
           code is no problem, but giving a whole file to someone
           is definitely a violation of the integrity policy.
           Also not allowed is working together and turning in essentially the same product with
           trivial differences.
           <p><b>Sharing or copying
           will result in grade penalties for all involved parties.</b></p>
      </dd>

    <dt>Homework</dt>
      <dd>Homework will be collected at the start of the class period every Monday. Because we will discuss the problems in class, <b>late homework will not be accepted</b>. If you have a valid excuse (health, personal emergency, etc.), your grade will be adjusted.</dd>

    <dt>Matlab</dt>
      <dd> Using the software package Matlab is a required
        part of the course. A fully functional student version is available for $100. 
		Homework problems using Matlab should be formatted using the &quot;publishing&quot; feature, which will be demonstrated in class.
      </dd>
	
    <dt>Exams</dt>
      <dd>There will be two midterm exams on nonoverlapping units of the course.</dd>
	  
	<dt>Final exam</dt>	
	  <dd>There will be a final exam. It may have both take-home and in-class components. <b>You should plan to stay available for the full final exam period.</b> </dd>


    <dt>Grading</dt>
        <dd>Each midterm will be worth 100 points. The final will be worth 200 points. Other points will be awarded as follows.
		<ul>
		<li><b>Quizzes.</b> Each Wednesday quiz will have an "A-level" and a "B-level" question, worth up to 5 and 3 points respectively. You can choose one problem each time.</li>
		<li><b>Homework solutions.</b> Each homework assignment will contain both "A-level" and "B-level" problems, worth up to 10 or 6 points. You may choose any two problems to turn in each week.</li>
		<li><b>Homework discussions.</b> On each Monday (except exam dates), you may be given an opportunity to present the solution to a homework problem to the class. This opportunity is worth 8/4 points for an A/B problem. If you want, you can "phone a friend" for help with the presentation and share the points. 
		</ul>
		You will have an opportunity for a <i>maximum</i> of over 300 points, but I expect that anything in the 280's or above will be good.
