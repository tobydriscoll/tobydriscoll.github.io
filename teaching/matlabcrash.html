<p> SIAM (the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) will be
publishing <i>Learning MATLAB</i>, an updated and improved version of
the "Crash course in MATLAB", in spring or summer 2009. It will be
available in print and as an e-book. Pricing is unknown at this
writing, but a major goal has been to keep the length and price
appropriate for a supplemental textbook.</p>

<p>
This book represents the evolution of a MATLAB cheat sheet that grew
to a hundred pages over a period of more than ten years. For all of
that time, I have made various incarnations of the "Crash course"
available on the web for free. However, SIAM is rightfully concerned
about eating into new sales, and they have requested that I no longer
make the "Crash course" available on this site. I apologize for any
inconvenience this may cause.</p>
