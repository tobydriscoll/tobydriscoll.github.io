        <dt><h3>Meetings</h3></dt>
        <dd>MWF 11:15-12:05 in Brown 205. Attendance is at your discretion, though
        you are always responsible for what is covered in class.
        </dd>

        <dt><h3>Textbook and notes</h3></dt>
        <dd>
        The textbook for the course is <i>Numerical Analysis</i>, 7th ed.,
        by Burden and Faires. However, the course will not follow the book closely
        in every regard. There is
        also a set of notes written by me that you are required to buy from
        the bookstore. (No, I don't get a kickback.) <b>The notes
        should be considered the primary source material.</b>
        Some of the material in the notes does not appear in the text.
        </dd>

        <dt><h3>Due dates</h3></dt>
        <dd>Assignments are due by 5 PM on the due date. These dates are
        not negotiable. <b> Late work will not be
        accepted</b> without a valid excuse.
        </dd>


        <dt><h3>Academic integrity</h3></dt>
        <dd> You are expected and encouraged to discuss
        problems with others. However,
        the work you turn in must be completely your own.

          <p>For example, fixing an error in one line of a classmate's
          code is no big deal.  Emailing your entire solution to him
          <i>is</i> a big deal and is a violation of the integrity policy.
          So is working side-by-side and turning in the same code with
          some variable names changed.</p>

        <p><b>Sharing or copying
        will result in penalties for all involved parties.</b> A
        first incident will typically result in a zero
        score; a second incident will probably result in failing
        the course and a referral for disciplinary action.</p>


        <dt><h3>Homework</h3></dt>
        <dd> Homework will be collected on Wednesdays (not
        necessarily every week).
        Expect the homework assignments to be
        time-consuming. They are a major component of the course
        and your grade.
        </dd>

        <dt><h3>MATLAB</h3></dt>
        <dd> Learning and using the software package MATLAB is a
        part of the course. The course notes have an appendix with a basic guide to MATLAB. This
        should be enough to get you through the class. If you want a more
        complete reference, I recommend <i>Getting Started with MATLAB</i>
        by R. Pratap.
        You can use MATLAB in certain university labs, run it on the
        UNIX mainframes, or purchase a student version for about \$100 from
        mathworks.com. For more information, visit <a href="matlab/index.html">the web site</a>.
        </dd>


        <dt><h3>Exams<br></h3></dt>
        <dd>There will be two pencil-and-paper midterm exams on nonoverlapping
        units of the course.
        </dd>

        <dt><h3>Projects<br></h3></dt>
        <dd>There will be two projects throughout the term,
        including one due during the finals period. They will test your
        ability to solve more complex computer problems than are found on
        the homework.
        </dd>
