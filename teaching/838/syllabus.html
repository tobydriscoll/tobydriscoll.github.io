    <h2>Course information for MATH 838<br>Part I: Radial basis functions</h2>
    <dl>
    <dt>Instructor</dt>
      <dd>Prof. Toby Driscoll<br>
        505 Ewing Hall<br>
        831-3383 or driscoll(AT)math.udel.edu<br>
        <i>Office hours:</i> Wed 1:30-2:30, Fri 10-12, or by appointment<br>
      </dd>
    <dt>Meetings</dt>
      <dd>TR 3:30-4:45, in Ewing 207.</dd>
    
			<dt>Schedule/structure</dt>
			<dd>This topics course is being split between two professors. Prof. Rossi will teach part II of the 
			course following spring break. Your course grade will be the average over the two parts. </dd>
			
    <dt>Textbook (optional)</dt>
      <dd>Fasshauer, <i>Meshfree Approximation Methods With MATLAB</i></dd>

      
    <dt>Academic integrity</dt>
      <dd> You are expected and encouraged to discuss problems with others. However,
            the work you turn in must be completely your own.
           For example, fixing an error in one line of a classmate's
           code is no big deal.  Emailing your entire solution to someone
           <i>is</i> a big deal and is a violation of the integrity policy.
           So is working side-by-side and turning in the same code with
           some variable names changed.
           <p><b>Sharing or copying
           will result in grade penalties for all involved parties.</b></p>
      </dd>

    <dt>Homework</dt>
      <dd>You will be given 3 homework assignments. Some problems will be purely analytical, but a majority
			will be computational.  The homework will account for half of your part I grade.</dd>

    <dt>MATLAB</dt>
      <dd> I expect that you will use MATLAB for the homework. (If you have a compelling reason not to, come see me. 
			I can't promise much help for programs written in other languages.) I have written a <a href="http://www.math.udel.edu/~driscoll/teaching/basicmatlab.pdf">basic guide</a> that 
        should be enough to get you through the class. The online manuals with MATLAB and at mathworks.com 
				are thorough and include tutorials. I will also be doing demos in class and making my codes available on the web.
      </dd>

		<dt>Presentation</dt>
		<dd>You will choose a published journal paper on RBFs from a list that I will furnish before the end of February. 
		One of the final lecture periods in March will be given to you for presenting the material in the paper. You will
		be expected to demonstrate mastery of the material in the paper. This lecture will account for half of your part I grade.
