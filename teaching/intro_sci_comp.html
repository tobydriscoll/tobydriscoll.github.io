		<h2>Experimental course for Fall 2014: Introduction to Scientific Computing</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="page-region">
      <div class="page-region-content">
<p>	Computation has become integral to engineering, science,
    commerce, politics, humanities, and more. Most of this
    computation is in the form of the manipulation of numbers, not
    symbolic expressions (as in most math) or text and other discrete data
    types (as in most computer science). </p>
	<p>The purpose of this course, <i>Introduction to scientific
    computing</i>, is to provide you with an entry point into this
    young science. A successful student will learn valuable tools for
    future research and employment opportunities. More than that, you
    will learn a way quantifying the world that is complementary to the classical
    methods of calculus and abstract manipulation.</p>

	<dl>
	  <style> dd {font-weight:bold; padding-top:2ex;} </style>

	<dd>Prerequisite</dd>
     <dt>MATH 242 or equivalent placement by the department. If you want
     to take this course concurrently with 242, see me. </dt>
 
	<dd>Topics covered</dd>
	<dt>(still under construction)
	The plan is to cover descriptive statistics of data, harmonic
	analysis of signals, fitting functions to data, linear
	difference equations (recurrence relations), continuous
	dynamics (ordinary differential equations), and coding
	techniques such as validation, testing, and source control.</dt>

	<dd>Applications</dd>
	<dt><p>The course will be taught within the context of
	contemporary applications of computing. Some of these are
	drawn from current research projects. Examples include:
	analysis of human vital signs data, transformations of music
	and images, experimental data on human eyes, simple financial
	modeling and forecasting, and swarming and flocking
	behavior. Class interests may inform what will be covered.</p>

	<p>However, while the applications will be kept somewhat realistic,
	they are motivational and illustrative. The focus of the
	course is on the underlying mathematical and computational
	tools that apply in a wide variety of contexts.</p></dt>

  
	<dd>Resources</dd>
	<dt>The course will be taught with regular if not daily use of
	MATLAB, the most dominant environment for desktop scientific
	computing.

       It is <i>strongly recommended</i> that you have a reasonable
       personal laptop to use for the class. If that is impossible for you,
       see me. You will also be required to buy a student version of
	MATLAB, which is about $100, and valid for as long as you are
	a student. (There will be no textbook purchase required.)</dt>

        <dd>Pedogogical style</dd>
       <dt>The course will emphasize an active learning style. In other
       words, it will not be a traditional lecture/homework course,
       but resemble a 'flipped classroom.' This
       means that you will learn much of the content online outside of class meeting
       time, and regular attendance and energetic participation in
       class will be expected. </dt>

      <dd>Experimental course??</dd>
     <dt><p>For Fall 2014 this course will be given the number MATH 267,
     which is an 'experimental course.' This means that the department
     is
     evaluating it as a more permanent addition. It also means the
     course may be rougher around the edges than one of the old
     standbys.</p>

     <p>Because it will be at the 200 level, it might not count for
     elective credit in many majors and minors. See your academic
     adviser if you have questions. For Math B.S. majors, this course
     will be accepted as an alternative to CISC 220, though it will
     <i>not</i> be accepted as a substitute for advanced courses which
     require CISC 220 as a prerequisite. </p>

    <p>TL;DR: For those who don't always play it safe.</p>
