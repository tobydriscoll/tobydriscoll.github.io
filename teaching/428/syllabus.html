                <dd>All programming in the course is required to be done using MATLAB. It is available in many
department labs, a few campus labs, and as a reasonably affordable student edition.

		<dt>Academic integrity</dt>
			<dd>You are expected and encouraged to discuss problems with others.
				However, the work you turn in must be completely your own. <b>Sharing

academic dishonesty to
				the Office of Judicial Affairs without warning and on the

		<dt>Homework</dt>
                <dd>There will be 6-8 homework assignments throughout the semester. They are a mix of pencil-based and
computer-based problems. They are a major part of the grade, so you are expected to spend some time on them. </dd>
                        <dt>Labs</dt>
                        <dd>Some course meeting times will be devoted partially or entirely to computer lab exercises that 
you are to perform during class. 
		<dt>Exams</dt>
			<dd>There will be two midterm exams on nonoverlapping units of the
course.</dd>

                <dt>Final project</dt>
                <dd>Instead of a final exam, there will be a final project requiring you to apply knowledge to a 
computational problem.</dd>

				<dt>Synopsis</dt>
				<dd>
				Math 428 is about the translation of the basic tools of calculus to numerical computation. 
Since calculus is about functions and computers deal with finite lists of numbers, we first need to discuss the process
of interpolation connecting the two. Then we show how to differentiate and integrate in the computational sense. From there
we move on to solving differential equations, first ordinary (one independent variable) and then partial (in space and 
time, or multidimensional space). The subjects and techniques are connected perhaps a bit more directly than they are
in exact analysis.</p>
