		<h2>Course information for MATH 341:<br>Differential equations and linear algebra I</h2>
		<dl>
		<dt>Instructor</dt>
			<dd>Prof. Toby Driscoll<br>
				505 Ewing Hall<br>
				831-3383 or driscoll(AT)math.udel.edu<br>
				<i>Office hours:</i> T 9:30-11, W 2:30-4, or by appt.<br>
			</dd>

		<dt>Meetings</dt>
			<dd>MWF 11:15-12:05, in 209 Ewing. You are expected to attend
					and are responsible for what is covered in class.</dd>

		<dt>Required textbooks</dt>
			<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>Edwards and Penney, <i>Differential Equations and Boundary Value
					Problems: Computing and Modeling</i>, 3rd ed.</li>
				<li>Leon, <i>Linear Algebra With Applications</i>, 7th ed.</li>
			</ul>
			</dd>

		<dt>Due dates</dt>
			<dd>Assignments are due at the beginnings of class periods. <b>Late work will not be
				accepted without a valid excuse.</b></dd>

		<dt>Academic integrity</dt>
			<dd>You are expected and encouraged to discuss problems with others.
				However, the work you turn in must be completely your own. <b>Sharing
				or copying of work may result in grade penalties for all involved
				parties.</b> I reserve the right to refer all instances of
academic dishonesty to
				the Office of Judicial Affairs without warning and on the
				first offense. You should carefully read
				<a href="http://www.udel.edu/judicialaffairs/ai.html">the official
				university policies regarding academic integrity</a>.
			</dd>
<dt>Blogs</dt>
<dd>You will be required to blog about each textbook section before the lecture in
which it is covered. More information is given in a separate handout.</dd>
		<dt>Homework</dt>
			<dd>
			<!-- The homework problems are divided into "required" and
			"suggested" categories. You are to turn in <i>only</i> the required
problems, due at the beginning of class on certain Fridays. Since the number
of required problems is relatively small, you are expected to write them up
neatly and thoroughly according to <a href="guidewrite.pdf">these
guidelines</a>. Each problem will be worth 10 points. "Suggested" problems will
not be graded, but that does not mean they are less important. Your ability to
do them is essential to understanding the material. There is also a concrete benefit to doing them: <b>Each exam will have
at least one question drawn directly from the "suggested" problems.</b>-->
</dd>

		<dt>Exams</dt>
			<dd>There will be three midterm exams on nonoverlapping units of the
course, and a comprehensive final. No electronic devices or other aids will be
allowed on any exams.</dd>

				<dt>Synopsis</dt>
				<dd>
				Math 341 and 342 cover <i>dynamics</i> and <i>linearity</i>, two of the
most ubiquitous mathematical tools for understanding the natural world.
Dynamics, which was Newton's motivation for inventing calculus, helps us
understand phenomena that change in time or space--in other words, almost
everything. Linearity is an extension of the simple straight line to multiple
variables; since every smooth function looks linear if you zoom in enough
(there's calculus again), linearity is always the approximation of first
resort. Linearity can help us understand a great deal about dynamics, and
dynamics helps us to understand what to look for in linearity. In these
two courses the topics are intertwined in order to emphasize these
relationships.

				<p>Math 341 concentrates on the nuts and bolts: terminology, basic
theory, and examples of the most important types of problems that can be solved
exactly by humans. Math 342 will look at more advanced techniques and concepts,
including what to do when (as often happens) exact solutions cannot be
found, at least not by hand.</p>

				<p>Here is an overview of the topics for MATH 341. Book sections are guidelines--go to class to find out what is 				actually covered.</p>
