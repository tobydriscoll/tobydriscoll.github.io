# Cubic splines

```{index} interpolation; by piecewise polynomials
```

```{margin}
A cubic spline is a piecewise cubic function that has two continuous derivatives everywhere.
```

A piecewise linear interpolant is continuous but has discontinuities in its derivative. We often desire a smoother interpolant, i.e., one that has one or more continuous derivatives.  A {term}`cubic spline` is a piecewise cubic function that has two continuous derivatives everywhere. To respect the terminology we use $S(x)$ to denote the spline interpolant.

As before, suppose that distinct nodes $t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_n$ (not necessarily equally spaced) and data $y_0,\ldots,y_n$ are given. For any $k=1,\ldots,n$, the spline $S(x)$ on the interval $[t_{k-1},t_k]$ is by definition a cubic polynomial $S_k(x)$, which we express as

```{math}
 :label: splinepw
 S_k(x) = a_k + b_k(x-t_{k-1}) + c_k(x-t_{k-1})^2 + d_k(x-t_{k-1})^3, \qquad k=1,\ldots,n,
```

where $a_k,b_k,c_k,d_k$ are values to be determined. Overall there are $4n$ such undetermined coefficients.

## Smoothness conditions

We are able to ensure that $S$ has at least two continuous derivatives everywhere by means of the following constraints.

- *Interpolation by $S_k$ at both of its endpoints.*

Algebraically we require $S_k(t_{k-1})=y_{k-1}$ and $S_k(t_k)=y_k$ for every $k=1,\dots,n$. In terms of {eq}`splinepw`, these conditions are

```{math}
:label: spline0a
a_k = y_{k-1}
```

```{math}
:label: spline0b
    a_k + b_k  h_k + c_k h_k^2 + d_k h_k^3 = y_{k} \qquad k=1,\ldots,n,
```

where we have used the definition

```{math}
:label: splineh
h_k = t_{k}-t_{k-1}, \qquad k=1,\ldots,n.
```

The values of $h_k$ are derived from the nodes. Crucially, the unknown coefficients appear only *linearly* in the constraint equations. So we will express the constraints using linear algebra. The left endpoint interpolation constraints {eq}`spline0a` are, in matrix form,

```{math}
:label: spline0asys
\begin{bmatrix}
  \mathbf{I} & \boldsymbol{0} & \boldsymbol{0} & \boldsymbol{0}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{a} \\ \mathbf{b} \\ \mathbf{c} \\ \mathbf{d}
\end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
  y_0 & & \\ & \ddots & \\ & & y_{n-1}
\end{bmatrix},
```

with $\mathbf{I}$ being an $n\times n$ identity. The right endpoint interpolation constraints, given by {eq}`spline0b`, become

```{math}
:label: spline0bsys
\begin{bmatrix}
  \mathbf{I} & \mathbf{H} & \mathbf{H}^2 & \mathbf{H}^3
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  \mathbf{a} \\ \mathbf{b} \\ \mathbf{c} \\ \mathbf{d}
\end{bmatrix}
  =
\begin{bmatrix}
  y_1 & & \\ & \ddots & \\ & & y_{n}
\end{bmatrix},
```

where we have defined the diagonal matrix

```{math}
:label: splinehsys
\mathbf{H}  =
\begin{bmatrix}
  h_1 & & & \\ & h_2 & & \\ & & \ddots & \\ & & & h_n
\end{bmatrix}.
```

Collectively, {eq}`spline0asys` and {eq}`spline0bsys` express $2n$ scalar constraints on the unknowns.

- *Continuity of $S'(x)$ at interior nodes.*

We do not know what the slope of the interpolant should be at the nodes, but we do want the same slope whether a node is approached from the left or the right. Thus we obtain constraints at the nodes that sit between two neighboring piecewise definitions, so that $S_1'(t_1)=S_2'(t_1)$, and so on. Altogether these are

```{math}
:label: spline1
b_k + 2 c_k h_k + 3 d_k h_k^2 = b_{k+1}, \qquad k=1,\dots,n-1.
```

Moving the unknowns to the left side, as a system these become

```{math}
:label: spline1sys
\mathbf{E}
\begin{bmatrix}
  \boldsymbol{0} & \mathbf{J} & 2\mathbf{H} & 3\mathbf{H}^2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  \mathbf{a} \\ \mathbf{b} \\ \mathbf{c} \\ \mathbf{d}
  \end{bmatrix}
= \boldsymbol{0},
```

where now we have defined

```{math}
:label: splineJ
\mathbf{J} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  1  & -1 & & & \\ & 1 & -1 & & \\ & & \ddots & \ddots & \\ & & &1 & -1 \\ & & & & 1
\end{bmatrix},
```

and $\mathbf{E}$ is the $(n-1)\times n$ matrix resulting from deleting the last row of the identity:

```{math}
:label: splineE
\mathbf{E} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  1  & 0 & & & \\ & 1 & 0 & & \\ & & \ddots & \ddots & \\ & & & 1&  0
\end{bmatrix}.
```

Left-multiplying by $\mathbf{E}$ deletes the last row of any matrix or vector. Hence {eq}`spline1sys` represents $n-1$ constraints on the unknowns. (Remember, there are only $n-1$ interior nodes.)

- *Continuity of $S''(x)$ at interior nodes.*

These again apply only at the interior nodes $t_1,\dots,t_{n-1}$, in the form $S_1''(t_1)=S_2''(t_1)$ and so on. Using {eq}`splinepw` once more, we obtain

```{math}
:label: spline2
  2 c_k + 6 d_k h_k = 2c_{k+1}, \qquad k=1,\dots,n-1.
```

In system form (after cancelling a factor of 2 from each side) we get

```{math}
:label: spline2sys
\mathbf{E}
\begin{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol{0} & \boldsymbol{0} & \mathbf{J} & 3\mathbf{H}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{a} \\ \mathbf{b} \\ \mathbf{c} \\ \mathbf{d}
\end{bmatrix}
= \boldsymbol{0}.
```

## End constraints

So far the equations {eq}`spline0asys`,  {eq}`spline0bsys`,  {eq}`spline1sys`, and {eq}`spline2sys` form $2n+(n-1)+(n-1)=4n-2$ linear conditions on the $4n$ unknowns in the piecewise definition {eq}`splinepw`. In order to obtain a square system, we must add two more constraints. If the application prescribes values for $S'$ or $S''$ at the endpoints, those may be applied. Otherwise there are two major alternatives:

- **natural spline:** $\quad S_1''(t_0)=S_n''(t_n)=0$
- **not-a-knot spline:** $\quad S_1'''(t_1)=S_2'''(t_1), \;  S_{n-1}'''(t_{n-1})=S_n'''(t_{n-1})$

While natural splines are popular and have important theoretical properties, not-a-knot splines give better pointwise approximations, and they are the only type we consider further.

In the not-a-knot spline, the values and first three derivatives of the cubic polynomials $S_1$ and $S_2$ agree at the node $t_1$. Hence they must be the same cubic polynomial! The same is true of $S_{n-1}$ and $S_n$.[^nak] We could use these facts to eliminate some of the undetermined coefficients from our linear system of constraints. However, rather than rework the algebra we just append two more rows to the system, expressing the conditions

[^nak]: This explains the name of the not-a-knot spline---for splines, "knots" are the points at which  different piecewise definitions meet.

```{math}
:label: splinenak
d_1=d_2, \quad  d_{n-1}=d_n.
```

Collectively, {eq}`spline0asys`,  {eq}`spline0bsys`,  {eq}`spline1sys`,  {eq}`spline2sys`, and {eq}`splinenak` comprise a square linear system of size $4n$ which can be solved for the coefficients defining the piecewise cubics in {eq}`splinepw`. This is a major difference from the piecewise linear interpolant, for which there is no linear system to solve. Indeed, while it is possible to find a basis for the cubic spline interpolant analogous to the hat functions, it is not possible in closed form to construct a *cardinal* basis, so the solution of a linear system cannot be avoided.

{ref}`function-spinterp` gives an implementation of cubic not-a-knot spline interpolation. For clarity it stays very close to the description given above. There are some possible shortcuts---for example, one could avoid using $\mathbf{E}$ and instead directly delete the last row of any matrix it left-multiplies. Observe that the linear system is assembled and solved just once, and the returned evaluation function simply uses the resulting coefficients. This allows us to make multiple calls to evaluate $S$ without unnecessarily repeating the linear algebra.

## Conditioning and convergence

```{margin}
The not-a-knot cubic spline has order of accuracy equal to four.
```

Besides having more smoothness than a piecewise linear interpolant, the not-a-knot cubic spline improves the order of accuracy to four.

````{proof:theorem}
 Suppose that $f(x)$ has four continuous derivatives in $[a,b]$ (i.e., $f\in C^4[a,b]$). Let $S_n(x)$ be the not-a-knot cubic spline interpolant of $\bigl(t_i,f(t_i)\bigr)$ for $i=0,\ldots,n$, where $t_i=a+i h$ and $h=(b-a)/n$. Then for all sufficiently small $h$, there is a constant $C>0$ such that

```{math}
:label: nakaccuracy
\bigl\| f - S_n \bigr\|_\infty \le Ch^4.
```
````

The conditioning of spline interpolation is much more complicated than for the piecewise linear case. First, the fact that the coefficients of all the cubics must be solved for simultaneously implies that each data value in $\mathbf{y}$ has an influence on $S$ over the entire interval. Second, $S$ can take on values larger in magnitude than all of the values in $\mathbf{y}$ (see [this exercise](`problem-splineovershoot)). The details may be found in more advanced texts.

3. ⌨️ For each given function, interval, and value of $n$, define $n+1$ evenly spaced nodes. Then use {ref}`function-spinterp` to plot the cubic spline interpolant at those nodes together with the original function over the given interval.

5. ⌨️  Although the cardinal cubic splines are intractable in closed form, they can be found numerically. Each cardinal spline interpolates the data from one column of an identity matrix. Define the nodes $\mathbf{t} = \bigl[0,\, 0.075,\, 0.25,\, 0.55,\, 1]$. Plot over $[0,1]$ the five cardinal functions for this node set over the interval $[0,1]$.

    **(b)** ⌨️ Modify {ref}`function-spinterp` to compute a periodic spline interpolant. Test by making a plot of the interpolant for $f(x) =\exp(\sin(3x))$ over the interval $[0,2\pi/3]$ with equally spaced nodes and $n=8$.
