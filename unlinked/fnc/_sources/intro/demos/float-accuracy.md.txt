# Absolute and relative accuracy

Recall the grade-school approximation to the number $\pi$.

```{code-cell}
@show p = 22/7;
```

Note that not all the digits displayed for `p` are the same as for $\pi$. As an approximation, its absolute and relative accuracy are

```{code-cell}
@show abs_accuracy = abs(p-pi);
```

```{code-cell}
@show rel_accuracy = abs(p-pi)/pi;
```

```{code-cell}
@show accurate_digits = -log(10,rel_accuracy);
```
