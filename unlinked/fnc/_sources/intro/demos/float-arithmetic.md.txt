# Surprising arithmetic

There is no double precision number between $1$ and $1+\epsilon_\text{mach}$. Thus the following difference is zero despite its appearance.

```{code-cell}
e = eps()/2
(1.0 + e) - 1.0
```

However, $1-\varepsilon_\text{mach}/2$ is a double precision number, so it and its negative are represented exactly:

```{code-cell}
1.0 + (e - 1.0)
```

This is now the "correct" result. But we have found a rather shocking breakdown of the associative law of addition!
