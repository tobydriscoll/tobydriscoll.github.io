    "Line 11 of {numref}`Function {number} <function-lufact>` points out two subtle Julia issues. First, vectors and matrix variables are really just references to blocks of memory. Such a reference is much more efficient to pass around than the complete contents of the array. However, it means that a statement `Aₖ=A` just clones the array reference of `A` into the variable `Aₖ`. Any changes made to entries of `Aₖ` would then also be made to entries of `A`, because they refer to the same location in memory. In this context we don't want to change the original matrix, so we use `copy` here to create an independent copy of the array contents and a new reference to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second issue is that even when `A` has all integer entries, its LU factors may not. So we convert `Aₖ` to floating point so that line 17 will not fail due to the creation of floating-point values in an integer matrix. An alternative would be to require the caller to provide a floating-point array in the first place.\n",

    "\n",
    "In your first matrix algebra course, you probably learned a triangularization technique called **Gaussian elimination** or row elimination to solve a linear system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$. In most presentations, you form an augmented matrix $[\\mathbf{A}\\;\\mathbf{b}]$ and do row operations until the system reaches an upper triangular form, followed by backward substitution. LU factorization is equivalent to Gaussian elimination in which no row swaps are performed, and the elimination procedure produces the factors if you keep track of the row multipliers appropriately. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like Gaussian elimination, the primary use of LU factorization is to solve a linear system. It reduces a given linear system to two triangular ones. From this, solving $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ follows immediately from associativity:\n",
