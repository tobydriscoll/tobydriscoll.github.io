abstract = {Symm's equation is a first-kind integral equation for computing conformal maps of simply connected regions. The package CONFPACK solves Symm's equation by an indirect boundary element method using an accurate corner representation. This solution technique is extended here to include nonoverlapping domain decomposition. Degrees of freedom are introduced on one or more interfaces and different unknowns are used, leading to a system of second-kind equations. The corresponding linear system can be expressed in Schur complement form. The accurate treatment of corners is preserved in the new formulation. The results of serial and parallel MATLAB implementations of the new algorithm show significant speedups as the number of unknowns grows.},

abstract = {The BIO2010 report recommended that students in the life sciences receive a more rigorous education in mathematics and physical sciences. The University of Delaware approached this problem by (1) developing a bio-calculus section of a standard calculus course, (2) embedding quantitative activities into existing biology courses, and (3) creating a new interdisciplinary major, quantitative biology, designed for students interested in solving complex biological problems using advanced mathematical approaches. To develop the bio-calculus sections, the Department of Mathematical Sciences revised its three-semester calculus sequence to include differential equations in the first semester and, rather than using examples traditionally drawn from application domains that are most relevant to engineers, drew models and examples heavily from the life sciences. The curriculum of the B.S. degree in Quantitative Biology was designed to provide students with a solid foundation in biology, chemistry, and mathematics, with an emphasis on preparation for research careers in life sciences. Students in the program take core courses from biology, chemistry, and physics, though mathematics, as the cornerstone of all quantitative sciences, is given particular prominence. Seminars and a capstone course stress how the interplay of mathematics and biology can be used to explain complex biological systems. To initiate these academic changes required the identification of barriers and the implementation of solutions.},

@article{Deng2012,
abstract = {A treecode algorithm is presented for the fast evaluation of multiquadric radial basis function (RBF) approximations. The method is a dual approach to one presented by Krasny and Wang, which applies far-field expansions to clusters of RBF centers (source points). The new approach clusters evaluation points instead and is therefore easily able to cope with basis functions that have different multiquadric shape parameters. The new treecode is able to evaluate an approximation on N centers at M points in \$O((N+M) \backslash log M)\$ time in the ideal case when evaluation points are uniformly distributed. When coupled with a two-level restricted additive Schwarz preconditioner for GMRES iterations, the treecode is well suited for use within an adaptive RBF iteration, previously described by Driscoll and Heryudono, as is demonstrated by experiments on test functions.},
