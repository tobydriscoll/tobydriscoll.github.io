%%
% A simple form of life insurance is purchased for a length of time $\tau$
% (the term of the policy) and costs the insured party a fixed amount $P$
% per year (the premium). If the insured dies during the term of the
% policy, the insurer must pay a benefit of $S$. Otherwise, the insured
% receives nothing.

%%
% The insurer is required to keep an amount of capital in reserve for this
% policy, in order to be able to pay out all the claims likely to result
% from a pooled group of individuals. This is done via the celebrated
% Thiele differential equation, first derived in 1875 and published in 1910
% [1].

%%
% Let $V(t)$ for $0\le t \le \tau$ be the amount of the reserve. Obviously, once
% the policy expires, no reserve is needed; hence, $V(\tau)=0$. Let the
% force of interest (more widely known as the continuously compounded
% interest rate) be denoted $\delta$, and let the force of mortality, a measure
% of the probability of a person dying in a small increment of time, be
% denoted as a function of age $x$ by $\mu(x)$. If the policy is issued at
% $t=0$ to an individual of age $A$, then

%%
% $$\frac{dV}{dt}=  P + \delta V(t) - \mu(A+t) \bigl(S-V(t)\bigr).$$
%

%% Force of mortality
% According to a study by the U.S. Social Security Administration, the
% force of mortality (using years as the unit of time) for an individual
% born in the U.S. in 1969 takes on the values [2]
mu_values = [0.02350 0.00211 0.02376 0.03429 0.04938 0.38292];

%%
% at the ages
mu_ages = [0 30 60 65 70 100];

%%
% In order to represent $\mu$ as a smooth function of time, we'll use
% Chebfun's |spline| command.
mu = chebfun.spline( mu_ages, mu_values );
plot(mu)
xlabel('age'), ylabel('force of mortality')

%% What is the age of minimum mortality, according to these data?
[~,agemin] = min(mu)

%% Calculating the reserve
% Let's get ready to issue a life insurance policy. We set a constant
% interest rate of 3 percent, an annual premium of 800 dollars, and a
% policy value of a million dollars. The term of the policy is set at 10
% years.
delta = 0.03;  P = 800;  S = 1e6;  tau = 10;

%%
% Given any starting age $A$, we can define a differential operator that
% encodes the Thiele equation:
thieleDE = @(A) @(t,V) diff(V) - (P + 0.03*V - mu(A+t)*(S-V));

%%
% Then we can also define a function of $A$ that returns the solution of the
% equation.
reserve = @(A) (chebop( thieleDE(A), [0 tau], [], 0 )) \ 0;

%%
% Here are the reserve amounts for policies issued to individuals of ages
% 25, 45, and 65:
plot( [reserve(25),reserve(45),reserve(65)] )
xlabel('time'), ylabel('reserve amount')
legend('25 yr old','45 yr old','65 yr old')

%%
% As you would expect, the amount of cash kept on hand is much higher for
% the older policy holders. Alternatively, the insurer could decide on a
% maximum amount of cash to keep on hand and charge higher premiums for
% older customers.

%% Calculating premiums
%  Instead of calculating the reserve for a given premium, we might want to
%  invert the calculation. Suppose the maximum cash reserve we wish to
%  allocate is $V_0$. If, as in our previous solutions, the maximum of
%  $V(t)$ occurs at the initial time, then we should add the condition
%  $V(0)=V_0$.

%%
% We now have a first-order equation and two boundary conditions. However,
% we also allow the premium $P$ to be a degree of freedom. Chebfun can solve
% for the value of a scalar parameter in this situation.

%%
% Let's fix $A=45$ this time. When we chose the premium to be 800, we found
% the reserve to be highest at the initial time and that about 74000
% dollars were required. What premium would we need to charge to lower that
% amount to say, $V_0=70000$ dollars? The BVP we solve is
thieleDE = @(t,V,P) diff(V) - (P + 0.03*V - mu(45+t)*(S-V));
L = chebop( thieleDE, [0 tau] );
L.lbc = @(V,P) V-70000;
L.rbc = @(V,P) V;

%% 
% The solution for the reserve barely changes...
u = L\0;  [V,P] = deal(u);
hold on, plot(V,'k')

%%
% ...yet the premium has increased by 50 percent.
