<h2> Trefethen's research </h2> 
Nick Trefethen has published over a hundred papers spanning many areas within numerical analysis and applied mathematics. An annotated list of his principal publications can be found <a><a href="http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/LNTpubs.pdf">here</a>.   

<h2> Short Biography</h2>
<p>
This is a short biography of Nick Trefethen (also appears <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/bio.txt">here</a>):  
</p>
<p>
Nick Trefethen is Professor of Numerical Analysis and Head of
the Numerical Analysis Group in the Oxford University Mathematical
Institute.  He was educated at Harvard University (AB 1977,
summa cum laude) and Stanford University (MS 1980 and PhD 1982)
and has held professorial positions at New York University (Courant
Institute), MIT, Cornell University, and Oxford University.  He is
a Fellow of the Royal Society (London) and a member of the National
Academy of Engineering (USA), and served as President of
SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) during 2011-2012.
</p>
<p>
As an author he is known for his books Numerical Linear Algebra
(SIAM, 1997, with David Bau, III), Spectral Methods in MATLAB (SIAM,
2000), Schwarz-Christoffel Mapping (Cambridge U. Press, 2002, with
Tobin Driscoll) and Spectra and Pseudospectra: The Behavior of
Nonnormal Matrices and Operators (Princeton, 2005, with Mark Embree);
he also won the Catherine Richards Prize for the best article in
Mathematics Today in 2000.  He has served as editor for many of the
leading research journals in numerical analysis, and spent four years
as Section Editor in charge of the major review articles in SIAM Review.
</p>
<p>
As a teacher he has won awards for graduate-level instruction at
MIT, Cornell, and Oxford.  An outgrowth of one of his graduate courses
at Oxford was the 2002 "SIAM 100-Dollar, 100-Digit Challenge",
which became the subject of a 2004 SIAM book by Bornemann, Laurie,
Wagon and Waldvogel and its 2006 Springer successor in German.
</p>
<p>
Trefethen is a Highly Cited Researcher according to
www.isihighlycited.com.  His approximately 100 publications in
research journals span a number of areas within numerical analysis
and applied mathematics, including non-normal eigenvalue problems
and applications, spectral methods for differential equations,
numerical linear algebra, fluid mechanics, computational complex
analysis, and approximation theory.  He is well known for his work on 
the pseudospectra, for the study of non-normal matrices and
operators, and as the inventor of Chebfun.
</p>
<p>
Trefethen was the first winner of the Fox Prize in Numerical Analysis
and was a Presidential Young Investigator.  During 1998/99 he was
the honorary Rouse Ball Lecturer in Applied Mathematics at the
University of Cambridge.  He received fellowships from the NSF
(both graduate and post-doctoral), Hertz Foundation, and IBM.
He is a frequent invited speaker at international conferences,
including the quadrennial International Congress of Mathematicians
(Berlin, 1998) and the International Congress on Applied Mathematics
(Hamburg, 1995).  
</p>
<p>
Trefethen was born August 30, 1955, grew up in Lexington,
Massachusetts, and attended Shady Hill School and Phillips
Exeter Academy.
