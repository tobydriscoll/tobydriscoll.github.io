<h2>Contributed talks</h2>
In addition to plenary lectures there will be a limited number of contributed talks. If you wish to offer a contributed talk, then please submit an abstract when you register for the conference (link above). 
We will then select contributed talks after April 30th. We are flexible on the format of the abstract, from a paragraph to a page is fine. You may wish to use a template:

<h2>Late registration</h2>
If you wish to attend and have not yet registered, then please <a href="mailto:new.direction2015@maths.ox.ac.uk">contact us</a> as soon as possible. Depending on space, we may be able to register you as an attendee. There are no more spots for contributed talks.  

<h2> Accommodation </h2>
<p>Accommodation will be provided for about 130 participants in <a href="http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/">Balliol college</a>.
En suite rooms will be charged at &#163;65 per person per night inclusive of VATand breakfast, and standard rooms will be &#163;50 per person per night. 
This accommodation is limited and we expect demand for places to be very high. Therefore, there is a chance we will ask you to find your own accommodation.
To apply for Balliol accommodation, please fill out the following form and send it to <a href="mailto:helen.taylor@maths.ox.ac.uk">helen.taylor@maths.ox.ac.uk</a>:
