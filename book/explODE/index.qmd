Written by [Nick Trefethen](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/),
[Asgeir Birkisson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/birkisson/?ppe=1), and
myself, *Exploring ODEs* takes a look at ordinary differential equations
unlike any other text. Rather than focusing on the mechanics of finding
solutions in a limited number of special problems, we use
[Chebfun](www.chebfun.org) to illustrate the wide range of behavior of
those solutions for a variety of linear, nonlinear, and multidimensional
problems, including initial-value, boundary-value, and eigenvalue
problems. Each short chapter includes a detailed application and a
favorite reference. The text is accessible as an accompaniment or
follow-up to a standard first undergraduate text on ODEs. All of the
MATLAB codes generating the examples and figures are available for
download, as is the full text in PDF, from [the book's
website](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/ExplODE/).
