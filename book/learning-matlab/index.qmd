*Learning MATLAB* is a concise, essentials-only introduction to MATLAB
for those who have programming experience in other procedural languages.
At about 100 pages, it's meant as a supplemental guide in a numerical
analysis or scientific computing course or as a standalone tutorial for
those who need to get started quickly in MATLAB. *Learning MATLAB* does
not cover every feature or calling syntax, but focuses on those parts of
MATLAB that have proven themselves indispensible to me in my 20 years as
a MATLAB programmer. (Fun fact: I was a runaway winner of "MATLAB
Jeopardy" at the 1995 MATLAB Conference.) The book grew out of a summer
workshop that I taught to grad students for 8 years at Delaware.

The chapters in *Learning MATLAB* are: Introduction, Arrays and
matrices, Scripts and functions, More on functions, Graphics, Advanced
techniques, and Scientific computing. Each feature is demonstrated by
examples, and every chapter includes exercises ranging from routine to
very challenging.
