\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose $A$ is an arbitrary $n\times n$ matrix and $v$ is a
  given $n$-vector. Show how to replace the diagonal entries of $A$
  with the entries of $v$. 

\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $W$ be a $60\times 60$ matrix of zeros and ones, uniformly
    randomly distributed.
  \item Find the column sums and row sums of $W$.
  \item Rescale the columns of $W$ so that the column sums of the
    result are all equal to one. This should be done without any
    loops.
  \end{enumerate}


\item 
Say you have a deck of 52 cards and perform a perfect shuffle, as
follows. Divide the cards into two equal stacks. Release them so that
they fall alternately one at a time, beginning with the card that was
\emph{not} on the bottom of the deck before.

This operation produces a permutation of the deck that can be
described by a permutation matrix $P$ applied on the left to a vector
of the orignal ordering. Write code to construct the matrix $P$
\emph{using as few characters as possible}. You do not have to count
spaces or new lines as characters.
