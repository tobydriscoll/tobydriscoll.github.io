  \bf Exercise: Shuffling a deck 
\end{center}

Say you have a deck of 52 cards and perform a perfect shuffle, as
follows. Divide the cards into two equal stacks. Release them so that
they fall alternately one at a time, beginning with the card that was
\emph{not} on the bottom of the deck before.

This operation produces a permutation of the deck that can be
described by a permutation matrix $P$ applied on the left to a vector of the
orignal ordering. Write code to construct the matrix $P$ \emph{using
  as few characters as possible}. You do not have to count spaces or new lines as characters.
