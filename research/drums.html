<h3>Isospectral drums</h3>

<IMG align="right" src="drums.gif">In 1991, mathematicians Gordon, Webb,
and Wolpert (<I>Invent. Math.</I> 110, pp 1--22) solved a famous problem
posed by M. Kac: "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" That is, do the Dirichlet
eigenvalues of a membrane determine the shape of the membrane? Their answer
was "No!", and they used a powerful mathematical technique to produce a
counterexample, which in its simplest form is a pair of eight-sided nonconvex
polygons.
<P>
Gordon, Webb, and Wolpert also noted that a more elementary technique known
as <I>transplantation</I> can be used to show that the spectrum of the Laplacian
with Dirichlet conditions is the same for both regions. However, actually
finding what the eigenvalues are is far more difficult; in fact, it's essentially
impossible to do analytically.
<P>
Determining the spectrum is also difficult to do numerically, at least to
very high precision. Standard finite-element approaches, as implemented in
PLTMG and the PDE Toolbox for MATLAB, are unable to produce more than a few
accurate digits using reasonable time and storage. Surprisingly, the method
of fundamental solutions, a well-known approach that was used successfully
to compute the eigenvalues of the L-shaped membrane thirty years ago, fails
to produce reliable results for these drums. Some progress can be made with
<A href="conformal.html">Schwarz-Christoffel mapping</A> techniques to
transplant the polygons to squares, but accurate estimates again would require
unreasonably large machine resources.
<P>
Wu, Sprung, and Martorell (<I>Physical Review E </I>, Jan 1995) present the
results of computations with a "mode matching" method and finite differences.
Their work appears to improve upon the accuracy of the first 25 eigenvalues,
but there is not much indicating how accurate their numbers are. Furthermore,
their mode matching method can't be used on general polygons.
<P>
A little-known method due to Descloux and Tolley performs far better than
all of these. The underlying principle is to exploit the well-known expansions
of an eigenfunction near the corners. The criterion that selects eigenvalues
is the matching of values and normal derivatives of the local expansions
at interfaces within the polygons. Using this method in MATLAB, and incorporating
a crucial improvement, I have computed 25 eigenvalues and modes for each
polygon to about 12 digits of accuracy. Each eigenpair takes just a few minutes
on a Sun workstation.
<P>
Here are some side-by-side comparisons of the first twelve modes, with estimates
of the eigenvalues. Exercise: Find an analytic expression for the ninth
eigenvalue!

<P>
Physicists Sridhar and Kudrolli at Northeastern University have actually
built microwave cavities in the shapes of the two polygons and determined
54 eigenvalues experimentally. Their results, however, are accurate only
to about 0.1%. Take <A href="modes136.gif">another look at modes 1,3, and
6,</A> to compare directly with
<A target=_top href="http://sagar.physics.neu.edu/isospec.html">Sridhar and
Kudrolli's experimental results</A>. For more details, see <I>Physical Review
Letters,</I> April 4, 1994, or <I>Science News,</I> September 17, 1994.
<P>
One of the most basic uses of eigenmodes is to represent vibrations governed
by the wave equation. Below are a few animations of such vibrations, based
on combinations of the first sixteen modes. Each movie runs for three periods
of the first mode, and is about 200K-300K in MPEG format.

You can obtain a copy of <A href="../pubs/drums.pdf"> "Eigenmodes of isospectral
drums,"</A> which appeared in the March 1997 <I>SIAM Review</I>. For hard
copies with color figures, <A HREF="mailto:driscoll@math.udel.edu">send me mail</A>.
You can see more examples of isospectral regions in this
<A target=_top href="http://www.geom.umn.edu/docs/doyle/drum/cover/cover.html">
paper by Buser, Conway, Doyle, and Semmler.</A> They also produce a pair
of "homophonic" drums: each has a special point at which the corresponding
normalized eigenfunctions have identical values. These drums therefore sound
alike when struck at the special points (the pair above would sound different
if played in the conventional manner).
