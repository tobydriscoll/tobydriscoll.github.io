  <h3>Adam James Driscoll</h3>
  <p>Adam was born on August 15, 2003--nearly a month earlier than expected. However, he arrived in
   excellent condition and went home after two days. You can look at <a href="Adam/index.html">this small album</a>
   and verify that he is simply perfect.</p>
    <h3>Digital photography</h3>
    <p>My most enjoyable toy at present is my digital camera (an
    Olympus 2020). You can see some of the results at <a href="http://photos.yahoo.com/tobydriscoll">this
    site</a>. I use Jasc's <a href="http://www.jasc.com/products/psp/">Paint Shop Pro</a>
    software at home. (I used to like <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a> a lot, but it crashed
    frequently for me on my home Windows machine. This was a few years ago, however.) Jasc also
    maintains a <a href="http://www.jasc.com/digitalphoto.asp?">Digital Photography Center</a> with 
    useful tips; another interesting site is <a href="http://www.retouchpro.com">Retouch PRO</a>. I recommend
    <a href="http://www.snapfish.com">Snapfish</a> for getting prints. The quality and durability are 
    excellent, and the cost is comparable to, if not better than, ink and paper at home. If you're
    impatient to see a few prints, you can always go to a kiosk at a camera store or 
    Wal-Mart. If you're chronically impatient, then by all means go buy a printer!</p>
    <h3>Sports &amp; rec</h3>
    <p>
      Being a daddy and living in the East
      (instead of <a href=
      "http://www.coloradoguide.com">Colorado</a>) has put a real
      damper on my ability to get outdoors a lot. Except for a
      brief go in the <a href=
      "http://www.800poconos.com/">Poconos</a> area of
      Pennsylvania, my <a href=
      "http://gorp.com/gorp/activity/skiing/ski_spor.htm#snowshoeing">
      snowshoes</a> haven't seen much action the last few years.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I've picked up since moving to Delaware is
         <a href="http://www.usra.org/">racquetball</a>.
         Racquetball seems to have fallen out of fashion somewhat
         in the US, which is a shame. It combines elements of
         power, speed, coordination, and strategy, and it's a good
         workout. I'm an intermediate player at best, but I always
         have a good time playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a brown belt in <a href=
      "http://www.isshinryukarate.com/">Isshinryu Karate</a>,
      though I'm not currently working out in any dojo and practice
      only sporadically.

    <h3>Nerd alert</h3>
    Some things I see on the web that appeal to my inner nerd:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Politicians, journalists, and many other people of
        importance often make outrageous <a href=
        "http://www.mathmistakes.com">math mistakes</a>. Our
        society shrugs at these errors and lies, but in my opinion,
        beliefs based on sloppy reasoning aren't worth having.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.straightdope.com">The Straight Dope</a>
        is for people who want the answers to life's most pressing
        questions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before you forward that great, absolutely true story of the
        lawyer who was arrested for arson after filing an insurance
        claim for his smoked cigars, maybe you should see if it's
        an <a href="http://www.snopes2.com">urban legend</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        How big <i>is</i> ten million? How about one hundred
        billion? <a href=
        "http://www.kokogiak.com/megapenny/default.asp">The
        MegaPenny Project</a> has some simple drawings to help you
        get perspective on large numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        You have to be a hard-core math nerd to decipher these
        <a href=
        "http://www.stanford.edu/~segerman/mathfonts.html">Mathfont</a>
        puzzles. (I play a key role in one of them.)
      </li>
      <li>
        What happens when you combine a cat, a pet door, a digital
        camera, and an image-recognition nerd? The <a href=
        "http://www.quantumpicture.com/Flo_Control/flo_control.htm">
        Flo Control Project</a>, of course.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also in the nerd-with-too-much-free-time category, I submit
        these <a href=
        "http://www.lipsons.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/mathlego.htm">mathematical
        LEGO structures</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        I've always had this weird thing about getting <a href=
        "http://nist.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Eastern/d/-5">the exact
        time</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The well-informed nerd, of course, reads <a href=
        "http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Ha ha

      I haven't found a consistently funnier site than <a href=
      "http://www.theonion.com">The Onion</a> (warning: loads of
      offensive material).
