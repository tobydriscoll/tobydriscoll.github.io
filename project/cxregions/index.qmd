[ComplexRegions.jl](https://github.com/complexvariables/ComplexRegions.jl) is an open-source Julia package for the representation of curves, paths, and regions in the complex plane. It includes facilities for Mobius transformations, and there is a [Python interface](https://pypi.org/project/cxregions/) as well.
