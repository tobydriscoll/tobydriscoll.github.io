[RationalFunctionApproximation.jl](https://github.com/complexvariables/RationalFunctionApproximation.jl) is an open-source Julia package for automatic representation of sampled data by rational functions in the complex plane. It implements the well-known AAA algorithm of Nakatsukasa, Sète, and Trefethen (2018) as well as a new variant for Thiele continued fractions, and it is easy to call from Python.
