  Something fun for Friday?


  My older son binge-watched [Futurama](http://www.cc.com/shows/futurama) on Netflix a few months ago. This was one of the funniest shows of at least recent TV history. Especially if you like nerdy, cultural-reference, rapid-fire style humor like a real [Gen-Xer](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/05/generation-x-americas-neglected-middle-child/).



  It's also probably the first and only time in television history that [a new mathematical theorem was proved for and first presented in a series episode](http://theinfosphere.org/Futurama_theorem). The whole run of the series had [numerous mathematical references.](http://theinfosphere.org/List_of_mathematics_references) This may have something to do with the fact that co-creator and writer [Ken Keeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Keeler) has a PhD in applied math from Harvard.
